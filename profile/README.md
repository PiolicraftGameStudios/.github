Working alone can bring you complications but you can also have complications in a team, but with Piolicraft it will be easier! Piolicraft Game Studio is dedicated to many things: Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons, Live2D Vtubers, Discord Bots and Unity Applications. We have knowledge in some programming languages: C#, C++, C, JavaScript and Json. Piolicraft also has a Betatester program. Betatesters are users who have access to updates of anything before its release date!
