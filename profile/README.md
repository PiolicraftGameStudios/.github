Working alone can bring you complications but you can also have complications in a team, but with Piolicraft it will be easier! Piolicraft Game Studio is dedicated to many things: Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons, Live2D Vtubers, Discord Bots and Unity Applications. We have knowledge in some programming languages: C#, C++, C, JavaScript and Json. Piolicraft also has a Betatester program. Betatesters are users who have access to updates of anything before its release date!
  
<h2>How can I be part of the Betatesters program? 🏆</h2>
To become a Betatester, you must first complete the training. To join the training, you need:
  
- Have at least 1 or 2 years on Discord.
- Have 5 months since you joined the official Piolicraft Discord Server.
- Maintain a minimum of only 3 warns, 0 bans and 0 kicks on the server.

If you already meet these requirements, contact a staff member by opening a ticket and showing proof that you meet all 3 requirements.
After proving it, the staff will grant you the role of Betatesters and you will have access to a list of special commands from the official Bot and to more channels on the Betatesters server.

<h2>What are the benefits of Betatesters? 🏆</h2>
The betatesters have many advantages within Piolicraft such as:
  
- Help the staff to find bugs, errors, problems, etc.
- You can test projects before their release date.
- You have access to more channels on the Betatesters server.
