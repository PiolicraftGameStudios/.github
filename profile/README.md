## Piolicraft Game Studios organization.

At Piolicraft we create many types of projects. We are the organization that created Craftdeath, CATsafio and we are allied with TeamBedrock. We also do many other independent projects. Piolicraft is mostly dedicated to Minecraft related projects, but also from time to time with Discord and Unity.

### Piolicraft internal projects on GitHub

These internal projects refer to tags or categories of these projects, each one is represented by a different color and named after itself.
